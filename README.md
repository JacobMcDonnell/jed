# JED - Jacob's ed

Jed is a line mode text editor written in Java. It is similar to ed but not a clone, infact the commands are changed. It currently works but has much room for improvement.

## Building Jed

```
make
sudo cp jed /usr/bin/jed && sudo cp jed.jar /usr/bin/jed.jar
```

## TODO

- Rewrite Parser function

- Add Regex support
